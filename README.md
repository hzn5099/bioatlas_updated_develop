# BioAtlas
The bioatlas uses OpenSeaDragon image viewer, an open-source viewer with capabilities for displaying, zooming and annotating high resoultion images.  Zooming in OpenSeaDragon is dynamic, smoothly transitioning from a zoomed-out image to zoomed-in without loss of resolution.  This differs from zoom levels used in traditional microscopes, but offers greater functionality.  Physical slides are saved in the database along with all requisite data for the slide.  The repository contains all imaging systems for the Zebrafish Atlas. 

For an introduction to the BioAtlas system, please see the [Guidebook][guidebook]
